			<p>I am a Papua New Guinean living in South Australia with my partner and children. I speak English and New Guinea Pidgin but also understand the language native to my Mother’s island home; PNG itself has over 850 different languages. I grew up and eventually worked on Lihir Island, which is 3 degrees south of the equator. Lihir hosts a gold mining operation in a dormant volcano and operations face the challenge of working with geothermal activity.</p>

<Section><h2>Interest in IT</h2>
	<article>
		<p>Cybersecurity positions, such as Security Software Developers, are vital professions in a society dependent on IT to function. My decision to pursue IT was influenced by my experience during the peak of COVID19 in cases in South Australia in April 2020. I home-schooled my children for a month and realised that even my primary school-aged children have a dependency on IT. This sparked my interest in the industry and prompted me to consider their security.</p>
		<p>After almost 5 years of being a stay-home parent of my 3 children, I had my apprehensions about beginning University and maintaining a balance between study and family life. Fortunately, I have had experience studying online through OUA and believe that they offer courses that allow flexibility and enough support services for my situation. It was through OUA that I discovered RMIT and found they offered the most appealing Degree Pathway for me.</p>
		<p>Through this degree pathway, I expect to develop the theoretical knowledge and practical experience necessary to begin a career in the IT industry. I look forward to the insights into Information Technology that make it the ever-evolving phenomena that it is. There is also an emphasis on communications and social interactions, that reminds us of the human component, I believe this will prepare me for the professional environment.</p>

	<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
	<Article>
		<p>Cyber security is an important facet of IT; ensuring users have access to and understand secure systems motivates me to pursue a career as a Security Software Developer. A Security Software Developer is involved in the creation and continuous development of software programs and applications. The primary focus is the security of clientele’s data and the efficiency of security in projects.</p>
	
	<h4>Job Advertisement</h4>
		<p><a href="CyberSecuritySoftwareDeveloper.pdf">Software Developer - Terra Shwartz </a></p>
		<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50387197">https://www.seek.com.au/job/50387197 </a></p>
		<p>Terra Shwartz is a Cyber Security Software Developer, seeking potential Developers or programmers. It boasts a “world-class cyber-security platform with supporting stack” and their advertisement suggests they favour demonstrated experience over formal qualifications. </p>
		<p>My ideal job requires technical knowledge, skills, and experience that I expect to achieve through university courses and eventually work experience in developing software programs. I expect to work and experiment with different programming software and languages as I progress in my university degree and eventually apply that knowledge in a software development career.</p>
		<p>The main function of a Security Software Developer is to develop innovative and secure software programs and applications. Extensive knowledge about potential security threats will ensure these are up to date with standards. From a security perspective, there is an additional need make conscious decisions about cybersecurity threats.</p>
		<p>Software developers are involved in all steps of the development process and are required to use problem-solving skills to identify and resolve issues. This skill is developed through experience and extensive knowledge of software development. A developer must have expert knowledge of several programming languages to be able to contribute to all stages of projects. Developers also need to demonstrate experience with a variety of developing software that is required by employers, programs involved with creating and testing code.</p>
		<p>Developers require communication and collaborative skills as they continuously work with individuals of different technical skill levels. Developers work in collaboration with teams and are involved throughout the life cycle of software programs and applications. Due to the level of involvement in a team, the ability to provide clear and concise written and verbal communication is important for the development of projects, especially in communication with clients.</p>
	
	<h4>My Plan</h4>
		<p>To acquire the skills necessary for a Security Software Developer, my first step is to acquire a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology online through RMIT and take any additional Cyber Security courses available. Throughout my degree I hope to work on personal programming projects to develop practical skills and eventually seek job opportunities that focus on training and work experience.</p>

	<Article><h4>16 Personalities Test</h4>
		<p><img src="16PersonalitiesTestResults.JPG" alt="16PersonalitiesResult"><p>
		<p>(Introduction | Adventurer (ISFP) Personality | 16Personalities, 2020) </p>
		<p>The 16 Personality Test suggests that an Introverted Turbulent Adventurer (ISFP-T) is an individual who portrays introverted, observant, feeling, prospecting, and turbulent behavioural traits. It is an informative, albeit general, insight into my personality. </p>
	<h4>Strengths</h4>
	<p>Introverts are not always recluses; I thrive when I am surrounded by like-minded individuals with a common goal. When the work is delegated in a team, I enjoy the balance between space to work independently and group activities. Issues arise when there is a lack of planning and delegation, in these instances, I actively focus on resolving issues as they arise.</p>
	<p>My concern for others and the goals set encourages me to maintain communication with my teammates. Observance is a characteristic that also describes me well and can be mistaken for an unwillingness to communicate. I often sit back and observe discussions before I form an opinion and contribute; this position allows me to assess and address risks better. Communicating effectively and with purpose is imperative when working in a team situation. Conflicts may arise when communication tools are not used appropriately, and I believe that by setting a standard for professional communication we can avoid and resolve any issues.</p>
	<p>Listening to and understanding all team members’ ideas is important when planning a project. Identifying the strengths and capabilities of all members will allow a team to plan and delegate accordingly. This allows us to make achievable goals and “Turbulent” personalities, such as myself, are compelled to apply these strengths to realise the most successful outcome.</p>
	<p>I am pragmatic in my approach to tasks and work well with short term goals. This approach enables me to be flexible when challenges arise, hence my “prospecting” behavioural trait.</p>
	<p> I show concern for the welfare of others by encouraging inclusivity and even distribution of responsibility. Individuals led by their “feelings” are not incapable of rational thinking. Teams are sometimes faced with ethical issues and I am inclined to apply empathy through mediation to help resolve conflicts.</p>
	<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
	<p>I prefer low-stress settings and I can be overwhelmed by unresolved conflicts and incomplete actions. When I am faced with a conflict, I often fixate on its resolve rather than work around it. In this sense, social interaction can be exhausting for me and affect my ability to work efficiently. I find that bonding as a team and building a sense of community can encourage all team members to invest in the team and project.</p>
	<p>When I choose to observe and make informed contributions, I inadvertently put pressure on myself to produce near-perfect work; this is time-consuming and exhausting. This affects my focus on the long-term goal, as I tend to focus on short-term goals. This can often cause confusion and a lack of cohesion in the project, for this reason, I suggest that team meetings are held at regular intervals to maintain focus. This is my incentive for emphasis on clear and concise planning and delegation in an open group forum.</p>
	<p>I aim to please all members of the group by listening intently and validating all contributions and inadvertently seek validation for my contributions. I consider the emotions of my teammates and this can affect my ability to reject ideas in fear of upsetting individuals and can be unnecessarily critical of my work. Communication plays an important role in balancing this, by opening the platform and encouraging group discussions, we share the responsibility for making decisions.</p>

	<h4>The Big 5 personality test</h4>
	<p>Below are my results from the Big 5 personality test, these are like behavioural categories described in the 16 Personalities Test. In a team setting my strengths as described by this personality test is my ability to interact well with others and my tendency to opt for realistic goals.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Factor I – Extroversion 33% </li>
		<li>Factor II – Emotional Stability 22%</li>
		<li>Factor III – Agreeableness 83%</li> 
		<li>Factor IV - Conscientiousness 41%</li>
		<li>Factor V – Intellect / Imagination 46%</li> 
	</ul>

	<h4>The learning Styles quiz (EMTRAIN AU)</h4>
	<p>According to the Learning Styles quiz, my approach to learning and style order is as follows, pragmatist, theorist, reflectors, and activist. Having the pragmatists and theorists as my primary and secondary learning styles suggests that I like to visualise the goal and thinking logically about how to achieve it. This approach may benefit a team’s momentum by encouraging clear and concise plans and preventing any future conflicts.</p>
	<uL>
		<li>Primary Learning Style - Pragmatists</li>
		<li>Secondary Learning Style - Theorists</li>
		<li>Tertiary Learning Style - Reflectors</li>
		<li>Quarternary Learning Style - Activists</li>

	<h2>Project Idea</h2>
	<Article>
		<p>Soil and air temperatures are a few of the factors that dictate the rate at which plants grow and consume nutrients (reference). My idea is to build on existing Soil Temperature Sensor technologies to enable users in the Adelaide Hills Region to make informed decisions about what to plant in specific soil conditions. Arduino and similar micro bit board hardware have been used previously in soil testing scenarios; using Arduino compatible software to create programs to manipulate this data. I intend to enhance this for users by coupling it with a user-friendly program that gives additional advice, matching the conditions with ideal crops.</p>
		<p>Gardening is part and parcel of living in the Adelaide Hills, picturesque agriculture and wine region. I hope to contribute to this culture by appealing to those who rely on easy to navigate technology for information and guidance. This advice is invaluable to gardeners of all skill levels and sure to contribute to their success.</p> 

		<h4>SOIL TEMPERATURE SENSOR & WHAT TO PLANT</h4>
		<p>Simply put, the purpose of a soil temperature sensor is to measure and record the temperature of the soil it is subjected to. Coupled with an Arduino Uno board, users can maintain records of a specific area over time and apply this knowledge when choosing crops come planting time. The focus of my improvement is the use of Arduino compatible software to create programs and present data in a specific way. Arduino hardware is easily accessible, and assembly of components for soil temperature sensors is a simple process.</p>
		<p>A simplified example of this is described by users of the SparkFun Micro Bit Board in a “Micro: Climate Experiment Guide” (micro:climate Kit Experiment Guide - learn.sparkfun.com, 2020). The experiment uses an LED array to show the current soil temperature and when prompted, it simply says “Plant” or “Don’t Plant” based on parameters in the coding. I intend to enhance this by creating a computer program that stores records and timestamps in a database and when prompted, returns a list of crops that are compatible with these planting conditions. Programming will require parameters determined by research of historical planting conditions in the region.</p>
		<p>In terms of a minimum viable product, a basic version will function by recording input data and assign general information for a temperature range based on parameters set in coding. By keeping the function simple, the performance of the coding can be tested before delving into versions that assign more specific information. Based on previous examples, the other components for this hardware make it easily modifiable, and later developments will consider the durability of these components.</p>
		<p>The Arduino will control the data input and output but there are other components to consider. The temperature sensor component will be inserted into the soil, when prompted it will take a reading of the temperature, notifying users if the reading was not recorded properly. The program will assign this data to a temperature range and locate the output data which is relevant to this range. Users may require data for extended periods, and the Arduino itself offers a limited amount of space. Through a comparison of Arduino projects, connecting a USB to a computer is the favoured solution for storage, particularly because it provides a timestamp for data.</p>
		<p>The challenge will be creating a program that can interpret and manipulate the data received. Arduino offers its own Software known as IDE which can be used across numerous operating systems. Creating code in the Arduino programming language and using general data from the region will provide the foundation for the program, users will have the capacity to add their data and be able to personalise their reports.</p>

		<h4>Skills Required</h4>
		<p>A basic understanding of building electronics and components is required; design can incorporate ideas from previous technology. I intend to acquire this knowledge by researching similar projects and incorporating the most successful structures.
		Developers do not require knowledge of any specific operating systems due to Arduino’s compatibility with various operating systems. Users will need to download the Arduino IDE and learn to use the program and language. Developers are required to know the Arduino programming language specific to Arduino however C and C++ can be used for coding in Arduino IDE.</p>

		<h4>Outcome</h4>
		<p>There is a wealth of information about gardening available, and it can be overwhelming to apply this knowledge to personal situations. Rather than solve a problem, it will appeal to those who engage with technology. This Arduino Temperature Sensor project will be a simple personal tool for gardeners of all skill levels in the region. It will enable gardeners to plan and reflect on their gardening techniques and hopefully pique the interest of beginners. If successful, it has the potential to be developed into a farmer’s tool that measures other factors that influence the success of crops throughout the year.</p>
